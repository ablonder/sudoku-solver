Reflection
Implementation: the constraint propagation and depth first search algorithms were fairly straighforward and fun.
Debugging: Initially, it didn't return any errors, just the wrong output. Eventually, I figured out that I was interrupting constraint propagation after propagating a square's value to only its first neighbor. I fixed the bug and was able to get it to solve sudokus successfuly.
I spent about four hours on this assignment.
